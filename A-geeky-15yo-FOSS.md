Well, that kid was me. Disappointed? eh, press <kbd>CTRL + W</kbd> for better life decisions.

## start of something beautiful

**2015**: I signed up on [GitHub](GitHub.com) at the age of 15 to host a small Rock, Paper or Scissors game I made in HTML and JavaScript <sup>[0]</sup>.
At that time, any repository with more than 10 lines of code intimidated me. As I explored more, I read about something called the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and frankly did not understand what it was but it sounded exciting nevertheless.

## university

**2018**: Fast forward 3 years later, I graduate highschool, land in an engineering college and to my surprise here we have clubs talking about the exact same program, there's seniors who have actually participated in the same program. Not gonna lie, I was intrigued. But I still had no idea how to actually participate.

_Internship_? isn't that just coffee runs ? <br/>
_Remote_? doesn't that stand for some faraway land ?

Freshman year of college is difficult especially if you are studying computer science/IT<sup>[1]</sup> because there's so many sub-fields in computer science, so many opportunities and If you are from India, most of your peers are here not because they like to tinker with technology but cz it's a booming field and they just want to get a high paying job with minimum effort. <sup>[2]</sup>

## learning

I spent my freshman year actively playing (and winning few) Capture The Flag cybersecurity competitions, tinkering with a [Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/Eshaan7/LED_Matrix_with_Rpi#demo) (yeah, that's what I bought for my 18th bday) and making [anything](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/bjg0ry/rename_subs_to_match_video_file_names_in_one/) and everything that I could with Python. Every single line of code I wrote may it be for class assignments or just some 5 lines of automation script, I pushed it onto GitHub because that was my idea of open source at the time - for anyone to see.

**mid 2019**: At the start of my sophomore year, I joined a very early stage startup as a Web Development Intern. I was very grateful for the opportunity and [learned many things](https://medium.com/techspace-usict/getting-that-first-internship-and-keeping-it-full-stack-web-at-a-startup-a750c42ee0d0?source=friends_link&sk=3f5008c11225bd34de82e6ba0be57333). After my 3 months there, I was confident<sup>[3]</sup> about my coding skills for the first time ever. Along the way, I also got a freelance gig - writing cyber security blogs for a swedish firm which paid really well.

Things were looking good for me.

## dilemma

Afterwards, all I could think about was: What _now_? I like coding, creating APIs, creating dashboards and I did spend last 3 months developing software which was fun but most of my freshman year was spent playing CTFs, [learning web security](https://medium.com/techspace-usict/pentesterlab-com-my-experience-totally-awesome-and-totally-not-getting-paid-for-this-4231ed35ccb6) and penetration testing or red teaming for career sounds really cool.

I started annoying people on linkedin asking them about their journey as a software engineer, their journey as a cyber security engineer, blah blah. Few replied.

I still had no idea what to do next and just wished I had a plan.

## planning is overrated

**Start of 2020**:
After my university exams were over, I actively started sharpening my pentesting and CTF skills on [hackthebox.eu](https://www.hackthebox.eu/profile/256874) platform. 

GSoC was approaching. In February, they released the final organizations and corresponding projects list but I lacked the motivation. Contributing to someone else's project is _hard_ and as I was practising pentesting so this summer I planned to do an internship in infosec, not development. I dropped the idea of applying for GSoC.

Meanwhile I was contacted on linkedin by a few recruiters for development internship and I gave them the same reason. Soon I found an infosec internship but it was really bad<sup>[4]</sup> and I quit after just 2 days. I heavily regretted saying no to the other opportunites. To add on top of that, COVID-19 was on the rise in India. A nationwide lockdown was announced and I couldn't even go out to meet my friends.

I was lost.

## all it takes is a single PR

That experience however devastating did make me want to take up software development again. I decided to look for infosec projects in the GSoC's project list that matched my techstack. I knew I was late, students have been contributing since last few months and I am only now looking to start.

-- a single PR = lots of motivation

-- amazing experience

-- found my niche: security software development

[0] I had totally forgotten about it but it's actually still [live](http://eshaan7.github.io/Rockpaperscissors).

[1] Maybe I am biased because I don't really know what it's like for domains other than science or tech except that all my friends who took commerce/humanities in high school are playing FIFA 8 hours a day, hanging out, spamming my snapchat as I stand wearing a white chemist coat mixing chemicals (that has nothing to do with my major) in a poorly ventilated lab while its 40Â°C outside at 4pm in the afternoon just for that very important attendance.

[2] TCS mass recruitment, ftw.

[3] Takeaway: Being paid to write code that is used in production and by others is indeed a good morale boost.

[4] The manager actually said to me "Just sit here alone and learn about session replay attack. Then start hunting on bugcrowd, you should be able to find your first bug in a month or so". First, I had found bugs before. Second, I am not here to do bug bounty and let your company take the credit for that. Sadly, this is what they did in name of _Red Team Ops_ and I was utterly disappointed.
